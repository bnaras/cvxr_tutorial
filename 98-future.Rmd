# Future Enhancements

## Version 1.1
- Higher dimensional variables
- New atoms and transformations
  * Support function
  * Condition number
  * Log transforms (log-normal-CDF, log-gamma)
  * Matrix operators (matrix fraction, geometric product, Pf eigenvalue)
- Disciplined quasiconvex programming (DQCP)
- Disciplined parametrized programming (DPP)
- System for differentiating the map from a problem's parameters to its solution [@cvxpylayers:2019]
