Constraints might be added to narrow the search space or to ensure the solution has certain properties. The kinds of optimization problems we address in this tutorial have the following form: \\[ \\begin{array}{lll} \\text{minimize} &amp; f_0(x) &amp; \\\\ \\text{subject to} &amp; f_i(x) \\leq 0, &amp; i=1, \\ldots, M\\\\ &amp; Ax=b &amp; \\end{array} \\] with variable \\(x \\in {\\mathbf R}^n\\). Further, we ask that the objective and inequality constraints \\(f_0, \\ldots, f_M\\) are convex: for all \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(\\theta \\in [0,1]\\), \\[ \\begin{equation} f_i(\\theta x + (1-\\theta) y) \\leq \\theta f_i(x) + (1-\\theta) f_i(y) \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation} \\] i.e., graphs of \\(f_i\\) curve upward, the equality constraints are linear, i.e., they can be expressed as a simple matrix equation \\(Ax = b\\). Geometrically, a function is convex if the chord or line segment drawn from any point \\((x, f(x))\\) to another point \\((y, f(y))\\) lies above the graph of \\(f\\), as shown below. Figure 1.1: Source: https://www.solver.com A function is concave if \\(-f\\) is convex. Every linear function is both convex and concave. Convex optimization problems have many nice properties: The region containing solutions, if any, is convex as it is the intersection of convex constraint functions. Since the objective is also convex, if we find a local optimal solution, it is automatically the global optimal solution. There are a host of applications of this problem in many fields, including machine learning and statistics. 1.1 Convex Problems in Statistics, Machine Learning Maximum likelihood estimation with constraints OLS regression, nonnegative least squares, logistic regression Ridge, lasso, elastic-net regression Isotonic regression Huber (robust) regression Support vector machine Sparse inverse covariance estimation Maximum entropy and related problems New methods are being invented every year! 1.2 Non-convex Problems A non-convex optimization problem is any problem where the objective or any of the constraints are non-convex. Not every problem is convex, and in fact, the non-convex set is much larger. Non-convex problems are harder to solve in general. However, even when a problem is non-convex, one may be able to find a convex relaxation, an approximation to the original problem, that can yield useful results. Thus, developing tools to solve convex problems can go a long way. "],
["getting-started.html", "Chapter 2 Getting Started 2.1 Solver Prerequisites", " Chapter 2 Getting Started The following are prerequisites. A recent R installation (version 3.5.x and up) will do. However, we highly recommend 3.6.0 so as to avoid any unforeseen problems with CVXR. CVXR version 0.99-6, which can be installed like any other package from CRAN. An IDE/editing environment such as Rstudio, Emacs, or equivalent. If you use Emacs, we recommend the version packaged and distributed by Vincent Goulet as it includes many useful modes. (We find, however, that recent versions of these Emacs binaries do not include poly-R or the poly-markdown packages by default; you’ll have to install them like any other Emacs package.) All the additional libraries that are used in this tutorial. The following code snippet in your R session will install them for you. required_packages &lt;- c(&quot;tidyr&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;nnls&quot;, &quot;ISLR&quot;, &quot;glmnet&quot;, &quot;isotone&quot;, &quot;profvis&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;survey&quot;, &quot;expm&quot;, &quot;RColorBrewer&quot;, &quot;kableExtra&quot;) install.packages(required_packages) 2.1 Solver Prerequisites CVXR comes with open source solvers, and most of the tutorial will use these built-in open source solvers. However, we will discuss use of commercial solvers, MOSEK and GUROBI in particular. These are optional and not necessary for the tutorial. If, however, you wish to follow along, you will need to install the (binary) solver packages provided by the vendors. Luckily, academic and evaluation single user licenses are available for free. Ensure you have the R development tools installed: Xcode on Macs, Rtools on Windows. 2.1.1 MOSEK Follow the general setup instructions. Obtain an evaluation or personal academic license. Follow the instructions provided to install the Rmosek package. Ensure that you can run any one of the R examples. 2.1.2 GUROBI Download GUROBI optimizer version 8.1.1. You will have to register for an account and accept the license agreement. Obtain an evaluation or academic licence. Install the GUROBI R package using these instructions. Ensure that you can run any one of the R examples. "],

These are much easier to solve, and the celebrated work of George Dantzig resulted in the Simplex Algorithm for linear programs. 3.2 Quadratic Programs When the objective \\(f_0\\) is quadratic in \\(x\\), the problem is called a quadratic program. 3.3 Cone Programs When \\(f_i(x) \\leq 0\\) for all \\(i\\) constrain \\(x\\) to lie in a convex cone \\(C\\), the problem is called a cone program. Examples of \\(C\\) are the positive orthant \\(\\mathbf{R}^n\\), the set of positive semidefinite matrices \\(\\mathbf{S}_+^n\\), and the second-order cone \\(\\{(x,t) \\in \\mathbf{R}^n \\times \\mathbf{R}: \\|x\\| \\leq t\\}\\). 3.4 Integer and Mixed Integer Programs When all elements of \\(x\\) are constrained to be integers, or even binary (\\(\\{0,1\\}\\)) values, the problem is called an integer program. If only a few elements of \\(x\\) are constrained to be integers, then the problem is a mixed integer program. "],
["solving-convex-problems.html", "Chapter 4 Solving Convex Problems 4.1 Verifying Convexity 4.2 Domain Specific Languages for Convex Optimization 4.3 References", " Chapter 4 Solving Convex Problems Although convex problems can look very difficult (nonlinear, even nondifferentiable), they can be solved very efficiently like a linear program. So, how does one solve such problems in R? One possibility is to match the form of the problem to an existing solver routine. For example, the well-known optimx package provides the following omnibus function: optimx(par, fn, gr=NULL, hess=NULL, lower=-Inf, upper=Inf, method=c(&quot;Nelder-Mead&quot;,&quot;BFGS&quot;), itnmax=NULL, hessian=FALSE, control=list(), ...) Here one has to specify a vector of initial parameters (par), the objective function (fn), optional gradient (gr) and Hessian functions (hess) depending on the method used, and upper and lower bounds for the solution. Obviously, the objective and the constraints must be supported by the optimx routines. Another possibility is to use a package such as ROI, which provides interfaces to a number of solvers, including solvers for convex problems. It offers an object-oriented framework for defining optimization problems, but one still has to explicitly identify the type of every objective and constraint. If you can transform your problem into a cone program and use a standard cone program solver, then you can use ROI in a straightforward way. 4.1 Verifying Convexity Even before attempting a solution, one has to verify a problem is convex. One can start with the basic definition @ref{eq:convex-function} or use first or second order conditions \\(\\nabla^2{f}\\succeq 0.\\) These often turn out to be tedious and hard to derive. Another possibility is to construct \\(f_i\\) out of a library of basic examples or atoms that are convex. These could be combined using calculus rules and transformations that preserve convexity, yielding a problem that is automatically verified to be convex. 4.2 Domain Specific Languages for Convex Optimization Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) are specialized languages for a particular application, implemented in a general purpose programming language. They have become useful for expressing, manipulating, and solving problems in specific contexts: circuit design (VHDL), graph layout (DOT), data (XML), etc. Over the last few years, specialized languages have become available for general convex optimization using the constructive approach discussed above. CVX and YALMIP, both implemented in Matlab CVXPY implemented in Python Convex.jl implemented in Julia CVXR implemented in R Such DSLs may result in code that is slightly slower, but they are extremely flexible and enable fast prototyping of novel methods. The last one, CVXR, is our focus and is described in a paper (Fu, B. Narasimhan, and Boyd 2019) that due to appear in the Journal of Statistical Software any day now. 4.3 References References "],

Users can quickly modify and re-solve a problem, which is ideal for prototyping and experimenting with new statistical methods. The CVXR syntax is simple and mathematically intuitive. Furthermore, CVXR combines seamlessly with native R code as well as several popular packages, allowing it to be incorporated easily into a larger analytical framework. The user is free to construct statistical estimators that are solutions to a convex optimization problem where there may not be a closed form solution or even an implementation. Later, we will see how such solutions can be used with resampling techniques like the bootstrap to estimate variability. "],

Variable() specifies a 1-vector, essentially a scalar Variable(m) specifies an \\(m\\)-vector Variable(m, n) specifies an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix There are also S4 classes representing certain special constructs such as semidefinite matrices as we shall see later. 7.2 Objectives, Constraints, and Problems The objective function should yield a scalar value. CVXR provides the Minimize and Maximize functions that take an Expression (another S4 class) as an argument. Standard arithmetic and generics are overloaded so that one may use any R function in the construction. Constraints are specified as a list. One may construct this list directly or via some iterative computation, once again using various R and CVXR functions in the process. In the above problem, the objective is objective &lt;- Minimize(sum((Y - X %*% beta)^2)) which uses the CVXR::Minimize function along with standard R functions such as sum and squaring. This allows one to seamlessly work with all standard R constructs. However, the same objective may also be specified as objective &lt;- Minimize(sum_squares(Y - X %*% beta)) using the CVXR::sum_squares function. As you use CVXR more and more, you will need to refer to the CVXR functions list to learn about these built-in functions. A problem takes an objective and an optional constraint. It serves as the complete representation of the problem along with associated data, like the Y and X in the code snippet above. 7.3 Solving the Problem Calling the solve function on a problem sets several things in motion. The problem along with the data is converted into a canonical form. The problem is verified for convexity. If it is not convex, the solve attempt fails with an error message and a non-optimal status. The problem is analyzed and classified according to its type: LP, QP, SDP, etc. Among the available solvers, a suitable one is chosen that can handle the problem. Two open source solvers are built-in: Embedded Conic Solver (ECOS) and Splitting Conic Solver (SCS), but there is also support for commercial solvers. The canonicalized data structures (matrices, cone dimensions) along with solver options, if any, are dispatched to the solver in appropriate form. Finally, the results from the solver along with some accessor functions for retrieving the solution and other quantities in the context of the solved problem are prepared and returned to the caller. There are several modes of failure that can occur. The problem may not be convex, and that is indicated via an error message. However, even when the problem is convex, the solver may not converge to a solution. The latter could be due to a number of reasons: tight tolerances, too few iterations, numerical issues, etc. Therefore, the solution status should always be examined. One option that can be very useful is verbosity, and this is specified by simply passing another parameter to CVXR::solve. result &lt;- solve(problem, verbose = TRUE) 7.4 Solver Options Solver options are unique to the chosen solver, so any arguments to CVXR::solve besides the three documented above are simply passed along to the solver. he reference for the specific solver must be consulted to set these options.

(In a classification setting, the values of the response would represent class membership in one of two classes.) The conditional response given covariates \\(x\\) is modeled as \\[ y|x \\sim \\mbox{Bernoulli}(g_{\\beta}(x)), \\] where \\(g_{\\beta}(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x^T\\beta}}\\) is the logistic function. We want to maximize the log-likelihood function, yielding the optimization problem \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\underset{\\beta}{\\mbox{maximize}} &amp; \\sum_{i=1}^m \\{ y_i\\log(g_{\\beta}(x_i)) + (1-y_i)\\log(1 - g_{\\beta}(x_i)) \\}. \\end{array} \\] One may be tempted to use log(1 + exp(X %*% beta)) as in conventional R syntax. However, this representation of \\(f(z)\\) violates the DCP composition rule, so the CVXR parser will reject the problem even though the objective is convex. Users who wish to employ a function that is convex, but not DCP compliant should check the documentation for a custom atom or consider a different formulation. CVXR provides the logistic atom as a shortcut for \\(f(z) = \\log(1 + e^z)\\). 8.3 Example We use example 4.6.2 of (James et al. 2013) with the Smarket data where a glm is fit as follows. library(ISLR) data(Smarket) glmfit &lt;- stats::glm(formula = Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + Volume, data = Smarket, family = binomial) The CVXR formulation merely has to specify the objective after setting up the data matrices appropriately. y &lt;- as.integer(Smarket$Direction) - 1L X &lt;- cbind(1, as.matrix(Smarket[, c(&quot;Lag1&quot;, &quot;Lag2&quot;, &quot;Lag3&quot;, &quot;Lag4&quot;, &quot;Lag5&quot;, &quot;Volume&quot;)])) p &lt;- ncol(X) beta &lt;- Variable(p) objective &lt;- -sum(X[y &lt;= 0, ] %*% beta) - sum(logistic(-X %*% beta)) problem &lt;- Problem(Maximize(objective)) result &lt;- solve(problem) beta_hat &lt;- result$getValue(beta) We can compare with the standard stats::glm estimate.

How would you compute the fitted values from CVXR? Hint: The result$getValue() evalutes expressions in the problem context. 8.4.1 Solution A key feature of CVXR is that it exploits lexical scoping built into R. So one can evaluate various functions of the variables that are solutions to the optimization problem. The fitted values can be computed using fitted_values &lt;- 1 / (1 + exp(result$getValue(-X %*% beta))) We can also satisfy ourselves that the fitted values match the glm estimate, by computing the sum of squared differences. sum((fitted_values - glmfit$fitted.values))^2 ## [1] 1.294332e-14 Similarly, the log-odds, \\(X\\hat{\\beta}\\) , where \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is the logistic regression estimate, can be computed as follows. log_odds &lt;- result$getValue(X %*% beta) 8.5 References References "],

There are several packages in R to fit isotonic regression models. In this example, we consider isotone, which uses a pooled-adjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA) and active set methods to perform the fit. 9.2 Pituitary Data Example We will use data from the isotone package (de Leeuw, Hornik, and Mair 2009) on the size of pituitary fissures for 11 subjects between 8 and 14 years of age. data(&quot;pituitary&quot;) str(pituitary) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 11 obs. of 2 variables: ## $ age : num 8 8 8 10 10 10 12 12 12 14 ... ## $ size: num 21 23.5 23 24 21 25 21.5 22 19 23.5 ... Since the size is expected to increase with age, an isotonic fit is suggested, so we fit using the isotone package. res_p &lt;- with(pituitary, gpava(age, size)) The CVXR formulation expresses this pretty much in the mathematical form. We define a variable x of size n, the number of observations. The objective to be minimized is the least-squares error (cvxr_norm), yet another way of specifying least-squares loss. The monotonicity is specified using the diff function. 9.2.1 Exercise Can you explain why CVXR provide functions such as cvxr_norm and p_norm rather than just plain pnorm? 9.2.1.1 Solution In R, pnorm is already defined and refers to the density of the normal distribution. So we use a new generic cvxr_norm or p_norm (see CVXR functions to avoid confusion. The function cvxr_norm provides some specialized norms for matrices, whereas p_norm allows one to specify \\(p\\). x_p &lt;- with(pituitary, { n &lt;- length(size) x &lt;- Variable(n) objective &lt;- Minimize(cvxr_norm(size - x, 2)) constraint &lt;- list(diff(x) &gt;= 0) problem &lt;- Problem(objective, constraint) result &lt;- solve(problem) result$getValue(x) }) As the output below shows, the results are very close. print_matrix(cbind(res_p$x, x_p), col_names = c(&quot;isotone&quot;, &quot;CVXR&quot;)) isotone CVXR 21.000 20.99998 22.375 22.37499 22.375 22.37499 22.375 22.37499 22.375 22.37499 22.375 22.37499 22.375 22.37499 22.375 22.37499 22.375 22.37499 23.500 23.50003 25.000 25.00004 9.3 Handling Ties Package isotone provides additional methods for handling tied data besides the default ties = \"primary\" method; ties = \"secondary\" enforces equality within ties, and ties = \"tertiary\" enforces monotonicity on the means.

We do this below by figuring out the tied observation indices using base::split and forcing those x values to be equal (i.e. diff == 0). x_s &lt;- with(pituitary, { n &lt;- length(size) x &lt;- Variable(n) objective &lt;- Minimize(p_norm(size - x, 2)) secondary_constraints &lt;- lapply(base::split(x = seq_len(n), f = age), function(i) diff(x[i]) == 0) constraint &lt;- c(diff(x) &gt;= 0, secondary_constraints) problem &lt;- Problem(objective, constraint) solve(problem)$getValue(x) }) Here’s the comparison table.

Two of the most common regularization functions are the \\(l_1\\)-norm and squared \\(l_2\\)-norm, combined in the elastic net regression model (H.

The boot library provides all the tools for bootstrapping, but requires a statistic function that takes particular arguments: a data frame, followed by the bootstrap indices and any other arguments (\\(\\lambda\\) for instance). This is defined below. NOTE In what follows, we use a very small number of bootstrap samples as the fits are time consuming. neariso_fit_stat &lt;- function(data, index, lambda) { sample &lt;- data[index,] # Bootstrap sample of rows sample &lt;- sample[order(sample$year),] # Order ascending by year neariso_fit(sample$annual, lambda) } set.seed(123) boot.neariso &lt;- boot(data = cdiac, statistic = neariso_fit_stat, R = 10, lambda = 0.44) ci.neariso &lt;- t(sapply(seq_len(nrow(cdiac)), function(i) boot.ci(boot.out = boot.neariso, conf = 0.95, type = &quot;norm&quot;, index = i)$normal[-1])) data.neariso &lt;- data.frame(year = cdiac$year, annual = cdiac$annual, est = boot.neariso$t0, lower = ci.neariso[, 1], upper = ci.neariso[, 2]) We can now plot the fit and confidence bands for the nearly-isotonic fit.

Behind the scenes, CVXR compiles the domain specific language and verifies the convexity of the problem before dispatching it to a solver. Therefore, it is generally slower than tailor-made solutions for a given problem. 12.2 Example To understand the speed issues, let us consider the global warming data from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) again. The data points are the annual temperature anomalies relative to the 1961–1990 mean. We will fit the nearly-isotonic approximation \\(\\beta \\in {\\mathbf R}^m\\) by solving \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\underset{\\beta}{\\mbox{minimize}} &amp; \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^m (y_i - \\beta_i)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}(\\beta_i - \\beta_{i+1})_+, \\end{array} \\] where \\(\\lambda \\geq 0\\) is a penalty parameter and \\(x_+ =\\max(x,0)\\). This can be solved as follows. data(cdiac) y &lt;- cdiac$annual m &lt;- length(y) lambda &lt;- 0.44 beta &lt;- Variable(m) obj &lt;- 0.5 * sum((y - beta)^2) + lambda * sum(pos(diff(beta))) prob &lt;- Problem(Minimize(obj)) soln &lt;- solve(prob) betaHat &lt;- soln$getValue(beta) This is the recommended way to solve a problem. However, suppose we wish to construct bootstrap confidence intervals for the estimate using 100 resamples. It is clear that this computation time can quickly become limiting. Below, we show how one can get at the problem data and directly call a solver to get faster results. 12.3 Profiling the Code Profiling a single fit to the model is useful to figure out where most of the time is spent. data(cdiac) y &lt;- cdiac$annual profvis({ beta &lt;- Variable(m) obj &lt;- Minimize(0.5 * sum((y - beta)^2) + lambda * sum(pos(diff(beta)))) prob &lt;- Problem(obj) soln &lt;- solve(prob) betaHat &lt;- soln$getValue(beta) }) It is especially instructive to click on the data tab and open up the tree for solve to see the sequence of calls and cumulative time used. The profile shows that most of the total time (2400ms for one of our runs) is spent in the call to is_dcp generic (about 2000ms). This generic is responsible for ensuring that the problem is DCP-compliant by checking the nature of each of its components. The actual solving took a much smaller fraction of the time. 12.4 Directly Calling the Solver We are mathematically certain that our problem is convex, so we can avoid the is_dcp hit. We can obtain the the problem data for a particular solver (like ECOS or SCS) using the function get_problem_data and directly hand that data to the solver to get the solution. prob_data &lt;- get_problem_data(prob, solver = &quot;ECOS&quot;) ASIDE: How did we know ECOS was the solver to use? Future versions will provode a function to match a solver to a problem. (Actually, it is available already, but not exported yet!). For now, a single call to solve with the verbose option set to TRUE can provide that information. soln &lt;- solve(prob, verbose = TRUE) Now that we have the problem data and know which solver to use, we can call the ECOS solver with the right arguments. (The ECOS solver is provided by the package ECOSolveR which CVXR imports.) solver_output &lt;- ECOSolveR::ECOS_csolve(c = prob_data[[&quot;c&quot;]], G = prob_data[[&quot;G&quot;]], h = prob_data[[&quot;h&quot;]], dims = prob_data[[&quot;dims&quot;]], A = prob_data[[&quot;A&quot;]], b = prob_data[[&quot;b&quot;]]) Finally, we can obtain the results by asking CVXR to unpack the solver results for us. (See ?unpack_results for further examples.) direct_soln &lt;- unpack_results(prob, &quot;ECOS&quot;, solver_output) 12.5 Profiling the Direct Call We can profile this direct call now. profvis({ beta &lt;- Variable(m) obj &lt;- Minimize(0.5 * sum((y - beta)^2) + lambda * sum(pos(diff(beta)))) prob &lt;- Problem(obj) prob_data &lt;- get_problem_data(prob, solver = &quot;ECOS&quot;) solver_output &lt;- ECOSolveR::ECOS_csolve(c = prob_data[[&quot;c&quot;]], G = prob_data[[&quot;G&quot;]], h = prob_data[[&quot;h&quot;]], dims = prob_data[[&quot;dims&quot;]], A = prob_data[[&quot;A&quot;]], b = prob_data[[&quot;b&quot;]]) direct_soln &lt;- unpack_results(prob, &quot;ECOS&quot;, solver_output) }) For one of our runs, the total time went down from \\(2400ms\\) to \\(690ms\\), more than a 3-fold speedup! In cases where the objective function and constraints are more complex, the speedup can be more than 10-fold. 12.6 Same Answer?

The pliable lasso model has the form \\[ \\begin{equation} \\hat{y} = \\beta_0{\\mathbf 1} + Z\\theta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p(X_j\\beta_j + W_j\\theta_j), \\end{equation} \\] where \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the predicted \\(N\\times1\\) vector, \\(\\beta_0\\) is a scalar, \\(\\theta_0\\) is a \\(K\\)-vector, \\(X\\) and \\(Z\\) are \\(N\\times p\\) and \\(N\\times K\\) matrices containing values of the predictor and modifying variables, respectively, and \\(W_j=X_j \\circ Z\\) denotes the elementwise multiplication of \\(Z\\) by column \\(X_j\\) of \\(X\\). The objective function used for pliable lasso is \\[ J(\\beta_0, \\theta_0, \\beta, \\Theta) = \\frac{1}{2N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 + (1-\\alpha)\\lambda\\sum_{j=1}^p\\biggl(||(\\beta_j,\\theta_j)||_2 + ||\\theta_j||_2\\biggr) + \\alpha\\lambda\\sum_{j,k}|\\theta_{j,k}|_1. \\] In the above, \\(\\Theta\\) is a \\(p\\times K\\) matrix of parameters with \\(j\\)-th row \\(\\theta_j\\) and individual entries \\(\\theta_{j,k}\\), and \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) are tuning parameters. As \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow 1\\) (but \\(&lt;1\\)), the solution approaches the lasso solution. The default value used in the paper is \\(\\alpha = 0.5.\\) An R package for the pliable lasso is forthcoming from the authors. Nevertheless, the pliable lasso is an excellent example to highlight the prototyping capabilities of CVXR for research. Along the way, we also introduce some new atoms that are needed in this example. 13.3 Example We will use a simulated example from Section 3 of Tibshirani and Friedman (2017) with \\(n=100\\), \\(p=50\\) and \\(K=4\\). The response is generated as \\[ \\begin{eqnarray*} y &amp;=&amp; \\mu(x) + 0.5\\epsilon;\\ \\ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, 1)\\\\ \\mu(x) &amp;=&amp; x_1\\beta_1 + x_2\\beta_2 + x_3(\\beta_3 e + 2z_1) + x_4\\beta_4(e - 2z_2);\\ \\ \\beta = (2, -2, 2, 2, 0, 0, \\ldots), \\end{eqnarray*} \\] where \\(e=(1,1,\\ldots ,1)^T\\). ## Simulation data. set.seed(123) N &lt;- 100 K &lt;- 4 p &lt;- 50 X &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n = N * p, mean = 0, sd = 1), nrow = N, ncol = p) Z &lt;- matrix(rbinom(n = N * K, size = 1, prob = 0.5), nrow = N, ncol = K) ## Response model. beta &lt;- rep(x = 0, times = p) beta[1:4] &lt;- c(2, -2, 2, 2) coeffs &lt;- cbind(beta[1], beta[2], beta[3] + 2 * Z[, 1], beta[4] * (1 - 2 * Z[, 2])) mu &lt;- diag(X[, 1:4] %*% t(coeffs)) y &lt;- mu + 0.5 * rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 1) It seems worthwhile to write a function that will fit the model for us so that we can customize a few things such as the intercept term, verbosity, etc. The function has the following structure with comments as placeholders for code we shall construct later. plasso_fit &lt;- function(y, X, Z, lambda, alpha = 0.5, intercept = TRUE, ZERO_THRESHOLD= 1e-6, verbose = FALSE) { N &lt;- length(y) p &lt;- ncol(X) K &lt;- ncol(Z) beta0 &lt;- 0 if (intercept) { beta0 &lt;- Variable(1) * matrix(1, nrow = N, ncol = 1) } ## Define_Parameters ## Build_Penalty_Terms ## Compute_Fitted_Value ## Build_Objective ## Define_and_Solve_Problem ## Return_Values } ## Fit pliable lasso using CVXR. # pliable &lt;- pliable_lasso(y, X, Z, alpha = 0.5, lambda = lambda) 13.3.1 Parameters The parameters are easy: we just have \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\Theta\\). beta &lt;- Variable(p) theta0 &lt;- Variable(K) theta &lt;- Variable(p, K); theta_transpose &lt;- t(theta) Note that we also define the transpose of \\(\\Theta\\) for use later. 13.3.2 Penalty Terms There are three of them. The first term in the parentheses, \\(\\sum_{j=1}^p\\biggl(||(\\beta_j,\\theta_j)||_2\\biggr)\\), involves components of \\(\\beta\\) and rows of \\(\\Theta\\). CVXR provides two functions to express this norm: hstack to bind columns of \\(\\beta\\) and the matrix \\(\\Theta\\), the equivalent of rbind in R, cvxr_norm, which accepts a matrix variable and an axis denoting the axis along which the norm is to be taken. The penalty requires us to use the row axis, so axis = 1 per the usual R convention. The second term in the parentheses, \\(\\sum_{j}||\\theta_j||_2\\), is also a norm along rows as the \\(\\theta_j\\) are rows of \\(\\Theta\\).

Here, even a single fit takes a while, but techniques discussed previously can be used to speed up the computations. However, the potential of CVXR in prototyping novel methods is clear. 13.7 References References "],

Suppose \\(m\\) sampling units in a survey have been assigned initial weights \\(d_i\\) for \\(i = 1,\\ldots,m\\), and furthermore, there are \\(n\\) auxiliary variables whose values in the sample are known. Calibration seeks to improve the initial weights \\(d_i\\) by finding new weights \\(w_i\\) that incorporate this auxiliary information while perturbing the initial weights as little as possible, , the ratio \\(g_i = w_i/d_i\\) must be close to one. Such reweighting improves precision of estimates (Chapter 7, Lumley (2010)). Let \\(X \\in {\\mathbf R}^{m \\times n}\\) be the matrix of survey samples, with each column corresponding to an auxiliary variable. Reweighting can be expressed as the optimization problem (see Davies, Gillard, and Zhigljavsky (2016)): \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mbox{minimize} &amp; \\sum_{i=1}^m d_i\\phi(g_i) \\\\ \\mbox{subject to} &amp; A^Tg = r \\end{array} \\] with respect to \\(g \\in {\\mathbf R}^m\\), where \\(\\phi:{\\mathbf R} \\rightarrow {\\mathbf R}\\) is a strictly convex function with \\(\\phi(1) = 0\\), \\(r \\in {\\mathbf R}^n\\) are the known population totals of the auxiliary variables, and \\(A \\in {\\mathbf R}^{m \\times n}\\) is related to \\(X\\) by \\(A_{ij} = d_iX_{ij}\\) for \\(i = 1,\\ldots,m\\) and \\(j = 1,\\ldots,n\\). 14.3 Raking A common calibration technique is raking, which uses the penalty function \\(\\phi(g_i) = g_i\\log(g_i) - g_i + 1\\) as the calibration metric. We illustrate this with the California Academic Performance Index data in the survey package (Lumley (2018)), which also supplies facilities for calibration via the function calibrate. Both the population dataset (apipop) and a simple random sample of \\(m = 200\\) (apisrs) are provided. Suppose that we wish to reweight the observations in the sample using known totals for two variables from the population: stype, the school type (elementary, middle, or high) and sch.wide, whether the school met the yearly target or not. This reweighting would make the sample more representative of the general population.

One way to estimate \\(\\Sigma\\) is to maximize the log-likelihood with the prior knowledge that \\(S\\) is sparse (Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani 2008), which amounts to the optimization problem: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\underset{S}{\\mbox{maximize}} &amp; \\log\\det(S) - \\mbox{tr}(SQ) \\\\ \\mbox{subject to} &amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n |S_{ij}| \\leq \\alpha \\end{array} \\] with respect to \\(S \\in {\\mathbf S}_+^n\\), where the parameter \\(\\alpha \\geq 0\\) controls the degree of sparsity.

We use CVXR functions for the log-determinant and trace in the objective. The expression matrix_trace(S %*% Q) is equivalent to `sum(diag(S %*% Q))}, but the former is preferred because it is more efficient than making nested function calls. However, a standalone atom does not exist for the determinant, so we cannot replace log_det(S) with log(det(S)) since det is undefined for a Semidef object. 15.4 Results The figures below depict the solutions for the dataset with \\(m = 1000, n = 10\\), and \\(S\\) containing 26% non-zero entries, represented by the dark squares in the images below. The sparsity of our inverse covariance estimate decreases for higher \\(\\alpha\\), so that when \\(\\alpha = 1\\), most of the off-diagonal entries are zero, while if \\(\\alpha = 10\\), over half the matrix is dense. At \\(\\alpha = 4\\), we achieve the true percentage of non-zeros. do.call(multiplot, args = c(list(plotSpMat(Strue)), mapply(plotSpMat, S.est, alphas, SIMPLIFY = FALSE), list(layout = matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)))) 15.5 References References "],

We will solve this problem under various constraints. We have \\(n\\) assets or stocks in our portfolio and must determine the amount of money to invest in each. Let \\(w_i\\) denote the fraction of our budget invested in asset \\(i = 1,\\ldots,m\\), and let \\(r_i\\) be the returns (, fractional change in price) over the period of interest. We model returns as a random vector \\(r \\in {\\mathbf R}^n\\) with known mean \\(\\mathbf{E}[r] = \\mu\\) and covariance \\(\\mathbf{Var}(r) = \\Sigma\\). Thus, given a portfolio \\(w \\in {\\mathbf R}^n\\), the overall return is \\(R = r^Tw\\). Portfolio optimization involves a trade-off between the expected return \\(\\mathbf{E}[R] = \\mu^Tw\\) and the associated risk, which we take to be the return variance \\(\\mathbf{Var}(R) = w^T\\Sigma w\\). Initially, we consider only long portfolios, so our problem is \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\underset{w}{\\mbox{maximize}} &amp; \\mu^Tw - \\gamma w^T\\Sigma w \\\\ \\mbox{subject to} &amp; w \\geq 0, \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^n w = 1, \\end{array} \\] where the objective is the risk-adjusted return and \\(\\gamma &gt; 0\\) is a risk aversion parameter. 16.3 Example We construct the risk-return trade-off curve for \\(n = 10\\) assets and \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\Sigma^{1/2}\\) drawn from a standard normal distribution. ## Problem data set.seed(10) n &lt;- 10 SAMPLES &lt;- 100 mu &lt;- matrix(abs(rnorm(n)), nrow = n) Sigma &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n^2), nrow = n, ncol = n) Sigma &lt;- t(Sigma) %*% Sigma ## Form problem w &lt;- Variable(n) ret &lt;- t(mu) %*% w risk &lt;- quad_form(w, Sigma) constraints &lt;- list(w &gt;= 0, sum(w) == 1) ## Risk aversion parameters gammas &lt;- 10^seq(-2, 3, length.out = SAMPLES) ret_data &lt;- rep(0, SAMPLES) risk_data &lt;- rep(0, SAMPLES) w_data &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = SAMPLES, ncol = n) ## Compute trade-off curve for(i in seq_along(gammas)) { gamma &lt;- gammas[i] objective &lt;- ret - gamma * risk prob &lt;- Problem(Maximize(objective), constraints) result &lt;- solve(prob) ## Evaluate risk/return for current solution risk_data[i] &lt;- result$getValue(sqrt(risk)) ret_data[i] &lt;- result$getValue(ret) w_data[i,] &lt;- result$getValue(w) } Note how we obtain the risk and return by directly evaluating the value of the separate expressions: result$getValue(risk) result$getValue(ret) The trade-off curve is shown below. The \\(x\\)-axis represents the standard deviation of the return. Red points indicate the result from investing the entire budget in a single asset.

For instance, we could allow long and short positions, but impose a leverage limit \\(\\|w\\|_1 \\leq L^{max}\\) by changing constr &lt;- list(p_norm(w,1) &lt;= Lmax, sum(w) == 1) An alternative is to set a lower bound on the return and minimize just the risk. To account for transaction costs, we could add a term to the objective that penalizes deviations of \\(w\\) from the previous portfolio. These extensions and more are described in Boyd et al. (2017). The key takeaway is that all of these convex problems can be easily solved in CVXR with just a few alterations to the code above. 16.5 References References "],

As noted in the downloads page, Anaconda users can install merely via: conda install -c mosek mosek Others can use the pip command: pip install -f https://download.mosek.com/stable/wheel/index.html Mosek In addition, the license for the product has to be activated per instructions on the Sales section of the MOSEK web page. Once activated, you can check that CVXR recognizes the solver; installed_solvers() should list MOSEK. Otherwise, rinse and repeat until success. 17.3.2 Installing GUROBI GUROBI also provides an academic version that is free of charge. You must register to receive the license. Once registered, install the Gurobi Optimizer software and activate your license as necessary. After activation, you can check that CVXR::installed_solvers() lists GUROBI. Otherwise, rinse and repeat until success. 17.3.3 Gotchas If you have an Anaconda installation in your path, you have to account for the fact that there may be interactions when using RStudio and rendering documents. In particular, Anaconda may include its own version of pandoc and other tools that may conflict with what Rstudio needs to work properly. To be concrete, one problem we found was that the MOSEK solver was not recognized as available in this rendered document, even though the command line interface showed it to be present. Ensuring an appropriate PATH variable solves the problem. 17.3.4 Example Session installed_solvers() ## [1] &quot;ECOS&quot; &quot;ECOS_BB&quot; &quot;SCS&quot; 17.4 Solver Peculiarities The default solver in CVXR is ECOS. However, it is not always the best solver to use. As an example, let us consider again the catenary problem. We will change the problem slightly to use a finer discretization from 101 to 501 points. ## Problem data m &lt;- 501 L &lt;- 2 h &lt;- L / (m - 1) ## Form objective x &lt;- Variable(m) y &lt;- Variable(m) objective &lt;- Minimize(sum(y)) ## Form constraints constraints &lt;- list(x[1] == 0, y[1] == 1, x[m] == 1, y[m] == 1, diff(x)^2 + diff(y)^2 &lt;= h^2) ## Solve the catenary problem prob &lt;- Problem(objective, constraints) result &lt;- solve(prob) The solution status is no longer optimal. cat(&quot;Solution status is&quot;, result$status) ## Solution status is optimal_inaccurate In such cases, using a different solver may give more accurate results. Let us try MOSEK. if (&quot;MOSEK&quot; %in% installed_solvers()) { result &lt;- solve(prob, solver = &quot;MOSEK&quot;) cat(&quot;Solution status is&quot;, result$status) } else { cat(&quot;Solution not available as MOSEK is not installed!&quot;) } ## Solution not available as MOSEK is not installed! This returns an optimal solution. Here again, even commercial solvers differ; GUROBI, for example, does not completely solve the problem and in fact throws an error. 17.5 References "],
["the-structure-of-atoms.html", "Chapter 18 The Structure of Atoms 18.1 Definition 18.2 Atom Properties 18.3 Canonicalization 18.4 Putting It All Together", " Chapter 18 The Structure of Atoms CVXR comes with a rich library of atoms that represent common functions in convex analysis. When combined using the DCP rules, these atoms are sufficient to model and solve most convex optimization problems, and we encourage most users to work with the CVXR library. However, it is possible for a sophisticated user to add a new atom. To do this requires an understanding of mathematical programming and the S4 class system. In this guide, we go over the basics of implementing an atom, the quadratic-over-linear function, which should provide a starting point for potential developers. 18.1 Definition For any \\(x \\in \\mathbf{R}^n\\) and \\(y \\in \\mathbf{R}\\), the quadratic-over-linear (QoL) function is \\[ f(x,y) := \\frac{\\|x\\|_2^2}{y} \\quad \\mbox{with} \\quad \\mathbf{dom}\\;f = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbf{R}^n \\times \\mathbf{R}: y &gt; 0\\}. \\] In CVXR, atoms like this (along with variables, constraints, etc) are represented by S4 class objects. S4 allows us to overload standard mathematical operations so CVXR combines seamlessly with native R script and other packages. The class for the QoL function is QuadOverLin, defined as setClass(&quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, representation(x = &quot;ConstValORExpr&quot;, y = &quot;ConstValORExpr&quot;), contains = &quot;Atom&quot;) We also provide a constructor quad_over_lin &lt;- function(x, y) { new(&quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, x = x, y = y) } The QuadOverLin class inherits from the Atom superclass. It takes as input two arguments, x and y, which must be R numeric constants or CVXR Expression objects. These input types are encapsulated in the “ConstaValORExpr” class union. Since Expressions themselves may contain other atoms, this allows us to use the QoL function in nested compositions. During initialization, x and y must be passed to the Atom superclass for processing and validation. Consequently, we override the default QuadOverLin initialization method with setMethod(&quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(.Object, ..., x, y) { .Object@x &lt;- x .Object@y &lt;- y callNextMethod(.Object, ..., args = list(.Object@x, .Object@y)) }) The first two lines save x and y to their respective slots in QuadOverLin, while the third calls Atom’s initialize with args equal to the list of arguments. For explanatory purposes, we reproduce this method below. setMethod(&quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;Atom&quot;, function(.Object, ..., args = list(), .size = NA_real_) { .Object@args &lt;- lapply(args, as.Constant) validate_args(.Object) .Object@.size &lt;- size_from_args(.Object) callNextMethod(.Object, ...) }) It is not important to understand the details of the above code. Only recognize that the atom arguments are converted into CVXR objects and saved in a list in the args slot. We will be accessing this slot later. 18.2 Atom Properties Now that we have created the atom’s S4 class, it is time to define methods that characterize its mathematical properties. 18.2.1 Mathematical Basics First, we provide a method for validating the atom’s inputs. This method is called in initialize to check whether the arguments make sense for the atom. For our function \\(f\\), the second argument must be a scalar, so our validation method looks like setMethod(&quot;validate_args&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(object) { if(!is_scalar(object@args[[2]])) stop(&quot;[QuadOverLin: validation] y must be a scalar&quot;) }) The input object is a QuadOverLin atom. We access its arguments via its args slot inherited from Atom. Given our ordering in args, we know object@args[[1]] contains the argument for \\(x\\) and object@args[[2]] the one for \\(y\\). Hence, we invoke is_scalar, an Expression class method, on the latter to check if \\(y\\) is indeed scalar. If this check passes, then a call is made up the stack to validate_args in Atom. Notice that we did not check whether \\(y &gt; 0\\). This is because we generally do not know the value of an argument at the time of construction. For instance, y may contain a Variable that we are solving for in a problem, and we cannot define the problem if validation fails. It is the user’s responsibility to include domain constraints during problem construction. To facilitate this, we define a method for that returns a list of Constraint objects delineating an atom’s domain. For the QoL function, we need only constrain its second argument to be positive. Strict inequalities are not supported in CVXR, so we impose a weak inequality \\(y \\geq 0\\) as shown below. setMethod(&quot;.domain&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(object) { list(object@args[[2]] &gt;= 0) }) Both validation and domain methods may be dropped if an atom’s arguments span the reals. The to_numeric method is always required. It takes as input an atom and a list values containing the numeric values of the its arguments (given in the same order as in args), then evaluates the atom at these values. For the QoL function, this method is simply setMethod(&quot;to_numeric&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(object, values) { sum(values[[1]]^2) / values[[2]] }) Note the difference between object@args and values. The former is a list of Expressions, which represent a composition of constants, variables, and atoms. The latter is a list of R numeric constants like numeric and matrix, denoting the values of the corresponding expressions. 18.2.2 Dimension, Sign, and Curvature For DCP analysis to work, we must explicitly define each atom’s dimension, sign, and curvature. CVXR uses this information when applying the composition rules to an expression. It is easy to see that \\(f\\) is scalar-valued, nonnegative, and convex over its domain. These properties are encoded in setMethod(&quot;size_from_args&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(object) { c(1,1) }) setMethod(&quot;sign_from_args&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(object) { c(TRUE, FALSE) }) setMethod(&quot;is_atom_convex&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(object) { TRUE }) setMethod(&quot;is_atom_concave&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(object) { FALSE }) Here, the sign_from_args function returns a vector of two logical values - the first indicates if the atom’s value is positive, and the second if it is negative. We also define whether the atom is weakly increasing or decreasing in each of its arguments. By taking derivatives, we find that \\(f\\) is weakly decreasing in \\(y\\), weakly increasing in \\(x\\) on \\(\\mathbf{R}_+^n\\), and weakly decreasing in \\(x\\) on \\(\\mathbf{R}_-^n\\). These properties are spelled out in setMethod(&quot;is_incr&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(object, idx) { (idx == 1) &amp;&amp; is_positive(object@args[[idx]]) }) setMethod(&quot;is_decr&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(object, idx) { ((idx == 1) &amp;&amp; is_negative(object@args[[idx]])) || (idx == 2) }) where idx is the index of the argument of interest. We call the Expression class method is_positive (resp. is_negative) to determine if an argument is nonnegative (resp. nonpositive). The user may be tempted to write object@args[[1]] &gt;= 0, but this is incorrect because it returns a Constraint rather than a logical value. 18.2.3 Additional Characteristics The methods we have just described are the bare minimum required to define an atom. Additional methods may be implemented that provide further functional characterization. For instance, we furnish a method for computing the gradient of the QoL function, \\[ \\nabla_x f(x,y) = \\frac{2x}{y}, \\quad \\nabla_y f(x,y) = -\\frac{\\|x\\|_2^2}{y^2}, \\] at a point \\((x,y)\\). setMethod(&quot;.grad&quot;, &quot;QuadOverLin&quot;, function(object, values) { X &lt;- values[[1]] y &lt;- as.numeric(values[[2]]) if(y &lt;= 0) return(list(NA_real_, NA_real_)) else { # DX = 2X/y, Dy = -||X||^2_2/y^2 Dy &lt;- -sum(X^2)/y^2 Dy &lt;- Matrix(Dy, sparse = TRUE) DX &lt;- 2.0*X/y DX &lt;- Matrix(as.numeric(t(DX)), sparse = TRUE) return(list(DX, Dy)) } }) This method calculates the vectors \\(\\nabla_x f(x,y)\\) and \\(\\nabla_y f(x,y))\\), wraps each in a sparse Matrix, and returns them in a list ordered exactly like in the input values. If \\((x,y) \\notin \\mathbf{dom}\\;f\\), all gradients are set to NA. 18.3 Canonicalization Once CVXR verifies a problem is DCP, it converts that problem into a solver-compatible form. This canonicalization process is carried out through a series of calls to individual atom canonicalizers. To implement an atom, we must explicitly derive its canonicalizer for a conic program. Below we provide a derivation based on the graph implementation. A function \\(g: \\mathbf{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}\\) is convex if and only if its epigraph \\[ \\mathbf{epi}\\;g = \\{(x,t) \\in \\mathbf{R}^n \\times \\mathbf{R}: g(x) \\leq t\\} \\] is a convex set. Then, it can be written as \\[ g(x) = \\inf \\{t \\in \\mathbf{R}: (x,t) \\in \\mathbf{epi}\\;g \\}. \\] A similar relationship holds between concave functions and their hypographs. The graph implementation of a function is a representation of its epigraph or hypograph as a disciplined convex feasibility problem. This offers an elegant means of defining a nondifferentiable function in terms of a canonical optimization problem, which can be directly evaluated by a solver. For instance, the QoL function can be written as a second-order cone program (SOCP). Given \\((x,y) \\in \\mathbf{dom}\\;f\\), the inequality \\(f(x,y) \\leq t\\) is equivalent to \\[ \\begin{align*} 4\\|x\\|_2^2 &amp;\\leq 4ty = (y+t)^2 - (y-t)^2 \\\\ (y-t)^2 + \\|2x\\|_2^2 &amp;\\leq (y+t)^2 \\\\ \\left\\|\\begin{pmatrix} y-t \\\\ 2x \\end{pmatrix}\\right\\|_2 &amp;\\leq y+t \\end{align*} \\] so that \\[ f(x,y) = \\inf \\left\\{t \\in \\mathbf{R}: \\left(\\begin{pmatrix} y-t \\\\ 2x \\end{pmatrix}, y+t\\right) \\in \\mathcal{K} \\right\\}, \\] where \\(\\mathcal{K} := \\{(u,v) \\in \\mathbf{R}^{n+1} \\times \\mathbf{R}: \\|u\\|_2 \\leq v\\}\\) is a second-order cone. Thus, \\(f(x,y)\\) is the solution to an SOCP, which may be evaluated using any conic solver. The canonicalizer for the QoL function takes as input \\((x,y)\\) and outputs the above SOCP. In CVXR, this canonicalizer function is defined as QuadOverLin.graph_implementation &lt;- function(arg_objs, size, data = NA_real_) { x &lt;- arg_objs[[1]] y &lt;- arg_objs[[2]] # Known to be a scalar. t &lt;- create_var(c(1,1)) two &lt;- create_const(2, c(1,1)) constraints &lt;- list(SOC(lo.sum_expr(list(y, t)), list(lo.sub_expr(y, t), lo.mul_expr(two, x, x$size))), create_geq(y)) list(t, constraints) } It takes as input a list of arguments arg_objs, which specify the input values \\((x,y)\\), the size of the resulting expression, and a list of additional data required by the atom. The first two lines of the function extract \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) from args, the third line constructs the Variable \\(t \\in \\mathbf{R}\\), and the fourth line defines the constant \\(2\\). The fifth line forms the constraint \\(\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} y-t \\\\ 2x \\end{pmatrix}, y+t\\right) \\in \\mathcal{K}\\) with a call to the constructor SOC. If \\(u \\in \\mathbf{R}^n\\), then SOC(t,u) enforces \\(\\|u\\|_2 \\leq t\\). Finally, the canonicalizer returns a list containing \\(t\\), the epigraph variable, and a list of Constraints from the graph implementation - in this case, the second-order cone constraint and \\(y \\geq 0\\). 18.4 Putting It All Together With this machinery in place, we are ready to use the QuadOverLin atom in a problem. Suppose we are given \\(A \\in \\mathbf{R}^{m \\times n}\\) and \\(b \\in \\mathbf{R}^m\\), and we would like to solve \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mbox{minimize} &amp; f(x,y) \\\\ \\mbox{subject to} &amp; Ax = b \\end{array} \\] with respect to \\(x \\in \\mathbf{R}^n\\) and \\(y \\in \\mathbf{R}_{++}\\). In CVXR, we write x &lt;- Variable(n) y &lt;- Variable() obj &lt;- quad_over_lin(x,y) constr &lt;- c(domain(obj), A*x == b) prob &lt;- Problem(Minimize(obj), constr) solve(prob) Once solve is invoked, CVXR checks if the problem is DCP with calls to is_atom_convex, is_incr, and is_decr for each atom in the expression tree. It then converts the problem as modeled to a form compatible with the desired solver. In our example, this requires a transformation into a cone program. Substituting in the graph implementation of \\(f\\), our original problem can be written as \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mbox{minimize} &amp; t \\\\ \\mbox{subject to} &amp; Ax = b, \\quad (x,y) \\in \\mathbf{dom}\\;f, \\quad \\left(\\begin{pmatrix} y-t \\\\ 2x \\end{pmatrix}, y+t\\right) \\in \\mathcal{K}, \\end{array} \\] where \\(t \\in \\mathbf{R}\\) is the additional epigraph variable. If \\(b \\in \\mathbf{null}\\;A\\), a solution is trivially \\(x^* = \\vec{0}\\) with any \\(y^* &gt; 0\\). Otherwise, the point \\(y = 0\\) is infeasible, so we can relax the domain constraint to get \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mbox{minimize} &amp; t \\\\ \\mbox{subject to} &amp; Ax = b, \\quad y \\geq 0, \\quad \\left(\\begin{pmatrix} y-t \\\\ 2x \\end{pmatrix}, y+t\\right) \\in \\mathcal{K}. \\end{array} \\] In CVXR, this SOCP canonicalization is performed automatically via a call to QuadOverLin.graph_implementation. Then, the relevant matrices are formed and passed to the selected conic solver. After the solver returns \\((x^*,y^*,t^*)\\), the transformation is reversed to obtain the optimal point \\((x^*,y^*)\\) and objective value \\(f(x^*,y^*)\\) for the original problem. "],
