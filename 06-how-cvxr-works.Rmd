# How `CVXR` Works

Let us consider the nonnegative least squares regression example once
again.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
beta <- Variable(p)
objective <- Minimize(sum((Y - X %*% beta)^2))
constraints <- list(beta >= 0) 
problem <- Problem(objective, constraints)
result <- solve(problem)
solution_status <- result$status
objective_value <- result$value
beta_hat <- result$getValue(beta)
```

## Variables

The `CVXR::Variable` function constructs an S4 class describing the
argument of an optimization problem.

- `Variable()` specifies a 1-vector, essentially a scalar
- `Variable(m)` specifies an $m$-vector
- `Variable(m, n)` specifies an $m\times n$ matrix

There are also S4 classes representing certain special constructs such
as semidefinite matrices as we shall see later.

## Objectives, Constraints, and Problems

The objective function should yield a scalar value. `CVXR` provides
the `Minimize` and `Maximize` functions that take an `Expression`
(another S4 class) as an argument.  Standard arithmetic and generics
are overloaded so that one may use any R function in the construction.

Constraints are specified as a list. One may construct this list
directly or via some iterative computation, once again using various R
and `CVXR` functions in the process.

In the above problem, the objective is

```{r, eval = FALSE}
objective <- Minimize(sum((Y - X %*% beta)^2))
```

which uses the `CVXR::Minimize` function along with standard R
functions such as `sum` and squaring. This allows one to seamlessly
work with all standard R constructs. However, the same objective may
also be specified as

```{r, eval = FALSE}
objective <- Minimize(sum_squares(Y - X %*% beta))
```

using the `CVXR::sum_squares` function. As you use `CVXR`
more and more, you will need to refer to the [`CVXR` functions
list](https://cvxr.rbind.io/cvxr_functions/) to learn about these
built-in functions.

A problem takes an objective and an optional constraint. It serves as
the complete representation of the problem along with associated
data, like the `Y` and `X` in the code snippet above.

## Solving the Problem

Calling the `solve` function on a problem sets several things in motion.

1. The problem is verified for convexity. If it is not convex, the
   solve attempt fails with an error message and a non-optimal status.
   
2. The problem along with the data is converted into a canonical form.

3. The problem is analyzed and classified according to its type: LP,
   QP, SDP, etc.

4. Among the available solvers, a suitable one is chosen that can
   handle the problem. Three open source solvers are built-in: Embedded
   Conic Solver (ECOS), Splitting Conic Solver (SCS), and Operator Splitting 
   Quadratic Program Solver (OSQP), but there is also support for commercial 
   solvers.

5. The canonicalized data structures (matrices, cone dimensions) along
   with solver options, if any, are dispatched to the solver in
   appropriate form.

6. Finally, the results from the solver along with some accessor
   functions for retrieving the solution and other quantities in the
   context of the solved problem are prepared and returned to the
   caller.

There are several modes of failure that can occur. The problem may not
be convex, and that is indicated via an error message. However, even
when the problem is convex, the solver may not converge to a
solution. The latter could be due to a number of reasons: tight
tolerances, too few iterations, numerical issues, etc. Therefore,
the solution status should always be examined.

One option that can be very useful is verbosity, and this is specified
by simply passing another parameter to `CVXR::solve`.

```{r}
result <- solve(problem, verbose = TRUE)
```

## Solver Options

Solver options are unique to the chosen solver, so any arguments to
`CVXR::solve` besides those documented [here](https://www.cvxgrp.org/CVXR/reference/psolve.html) 
are simply passed along to the solver. The reference for the specific solver must be 
consulted to set these options.
