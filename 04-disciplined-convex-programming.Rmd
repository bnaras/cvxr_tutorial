# Disciplined Convex Programming

> "All... new systems of notation are such that one can accomplish
  nothing by means of them which would not also be accomplished
  without them; but the advantage is that when such a system of
  notation corresponds to the innermost essence of frequently occuring
  needs, one can solve the problems belonging in that category, indeed
  can mechanically solve them in cases so complicated that without
  such an aid even the genius becomes powerless. Thus it is with the
  invention of calculating by letters in general; thus it was with the
  differential calculus..."

## Basic Convex Functions

The following are some basic convex functions.

- $x^p$ for $p \geq 1$ or $p \leq 0$; $-x^p$ for $0 \leq p \leq 1$
- $\exp(x)$, $-\log(x)$, $x\log(x)$
- $a^Tx + b$
- $x^Tx$; $x^Tx/y$ for $y>0$; $(x^Tx)^{1/2}$ 
- $||x||$ (any norm)
- $\max(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$, $\log(e^{x_1}+ \ldots + e^{x_n})$
- $\log(\Phi(x))$, where $\Phi$ is Gaussian CDF
- $\log(\text{det}X^{-1})$ for $X \succ 0$


## Calculus Rules

- _Nonnegative Scaling_: if $f$ is convex and $\alpha \geq 0$, then $\alpha f$ is convex
- _Sum_: if $f$ and $g$ are convex, so is $f+g$
- _Affine Composition_: if $f$ is convex, so is $f(Ax+b)$
- _Pointwise Maximum_: if $f_1,f_2, \ldots, f_m$ are convex, so is $f(x) = \underset{i}{\text{max}}f_i(x)$
- _Partial Minimization_: if $f(x, y)$ is convex and $C$ is a convex set, then $g(x) = \underset{y\in C}{\text{inf}}f(x,y)$ is convex 
- _Composition_: if $h$ is convex and increasing and $f$ is convex, then $g(x) = h(f(x))$ is convex

There are many other rules, but the above will get you far.


## Examples

- Piecewise-linear function: $f(x) = \underset{i}{\text{max}}(a_i^Tx + b_i)$
- $l_1$-regularized least-squares cost: $||Ax-b||_2^2 + \lambda ||x||_1$ with $\lambda \geq 0$
- Sum of $k$ largest elements of $x$: $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^mx_i - \sum_{i=1}^{m-k}x_{(i)}$
- Log-barrier: $-\sum_{i=1}^m\log(−f_i(x))$ (on $\{x | f_i(x) < 0\}$, $f_i$ convex)
- Distance to convex set $C$: $f(x) = \text{dist}(x,C) =\underset{y\in C}{\text{inf}}||x-y||_2$

Except for log-barrier, these functions are nondifferentiable.
